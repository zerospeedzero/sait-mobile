    Our solution is targeting individuals of diverse demographics, including students, young professionals, and board game enthusiasts.   
    Our e-learning platform caters to a diverse range of learners, accommodating both beginners seeking an introduction to the Monopoly Game and competitive players looking to refine their strategic prowess and decision-making abilities to show off to their friends. 
    We are not looking to target those who are seeking an independent pastime. Monopoly itself is well known to be a game that takes quite some time to play so we also aren't looking to target those who are looking for a quick source of entertainment. 
    Values: 
    -	Being able to spend quality time with friends and family. Spending an hour or two playing Monopoly with friends and family sounds like a great way to become closer to them. 
    -	Being able to expand their knowledge. Monopoly may be a simple game to pick up but there are quite a few strategies to improve your chances of winning. The eLearning page will help those who are trying to learn more. 
    -	Being able to have fun. Monopoly is the most popular board game in the world for a reason. It is an easy and entertaining experience that anyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or nationality. 
    Behaviours: 
    -	People who are competitive. Monopoly is a game where you aim to make your fellow players bankrupt. You have to be at least a little competitive to play Monopoly if you want to win. 
    -	People who are persistent, Monopoly on average takes 60-90 minutes to complete a game, which can make the game exhausting to play for some. Also while playing Monopoly you are bound to run into unfortunate situations that may occur. Those who are persistent won't be as easily frustrated by these setbacks. 
    -	People who enjoy taking risks, Monopoly players may exhibit behaviours associated with risk-taking, such as making bold property acquisitions, investing in houses and hotels, or taking calculated risks in hopes of gaining a competitive edge. 
    Modules & Assessments 
    It is common to break down complex topics into smaller modules or topics, to make it easier for the learner to cover the material. How do you plan to take the above topic and break it into smaller modules for your user? And how will you test the user’s knowledge of each module? 
    Module 1: Beginner 
    Beginner Introduction to Monopoly: This topic covers the basic rules, objectives, and gameplay mechanics of the Monopoly Game, providing learners with a solid foundation to understand the key elements and dynamics of the game. 
    Glossary: We will cover words and terminology used in Monopoly and give a brief explanation as to what each term means to give new players a better understanding of the game. 
    Reviewing learners' knowledge: After studying the beginner module, learners will be assessed through an interactive matching game. The matching game will have the players match the terminology with the definitions. 
    Module 2: Tactics 
    Negotiation and Deal-Making: Learners will explore advanced negotiation techniques and deal-making strategies, examining scenarios that require effective bargaining, diplomacy, and strategic alliances to navigate complex interactions with other players. 
    Resource Optimization: This module focuses on optimizing resources such as houses, hotels, and utilities, examining efficient allocation strategies, property development sequencing, and resource utilization to maximize revenue and control the game board. 
    Late Game Strategies: This topic delves deeper into strategies that will assist towards the end of the game, securing your victory or building a stronger advantage. 
    Review: Reviewing the learner's knowledge to assess the knowledge acquired from the advanced module, learners will engage in simulated gameplay scenarios and decision-making exercises, evaluating their ability to apply advanced property strategies, negotiation skills, and resource optimization techniques in the context of the Monopoly Game. 
    Module 3: Variations of Monopoly 
    Pop Culture Collaborations: In this section, learners will be introduced to the vast array of Monopoly boards that are based on other household franchises. 
    Different Represented Media: We'll cover the different forms of media that are represented by Monopoly in this section. The aim is to find a version that may be interesting to the learner and showcase a Monopoly board pertaining to at least one of their interests. 
    Review: Reviewing learner's knowledge: Following the completion of the advanced module, learners will undergo comprehensive evaluations, including case studies and strategic analysis tasks, to assess their proficiency in advanced game theory, risk management, and competitive analysis within the Monopoly Game environment. 
    Challenges of the project by Monopoly Academy. 
    Content Adaptation: When explaining the game rules on our website, we need to ensure that they are easy to understand and user-friendly. Additionally, we want to keep our audience engaged and interested while providing practical information. Considering different learning styles and highlighting the strategic decision-making aspect is important. To achieve this, we will conduct further research on these aspects. 
    Technical Compatibility: We need to make sure that e-learning for Monopoly works well on the web browser, as it might include animations, a bunch of images, javascript…., etc., and the operating systems could be complex. It requires thorough testing and following web standards. 
    User Engagement: Keeping learners engaged during online learning can be challenging, but it could be done by adding interactive features, more interesting infographics, and attractive visual elements, also we can let users ask questions and feedback on our website.

    Introduction of Monopoly
    Monopoly is a popular multi-player board game where players roll dice to move around the board, buy properties, and build houses and hotels. The goal is to collect rent from opponents and drive them into bankruptcy.
    
    Players can gain or lose money through cards and tax squares, and they receive a salary when passing "Go". The game has various versions, spin-offs, and media adaptations, with international popularity. It originated from The Landlord's Game by Lizzie Magie in 1903, promoting the idea of rewarding individuals in the economy rather than monopolies.
    
    The current rules are based on one set from The Landlord's Game. Published by Parker Brothers in 1935, the game's name stems from the economic concept of a monopoly, dominating a market.

    Monopoly Basics
    Setup:
    -   Shuffle community chest and chance cards and place them in their designated areas.
    -   Set up a dedicated area for the "bank" and arrange all the money, Title Deed cards, and house/hotel cards in one place.
    -   The bank cannot run out of money. If you run out of physical bills, you can keep track of your money mentally, on a sheet of paper, using real money, etc.
    -   Give each player $1500 from the bank.
    o   2, $500 bills
    o   2, $100 bills
    o   2, $50 bills
    o   6, $20 bills
    o   5, $10 bills
    o   5, $5 bills
    o   5, $1 bills
    -   Each player will choose a figure to represent themselves.
    Objective:
    -   Be the only player left in the game with money.
    -   Buy and manage properties, then charge other players rent for landing on properties that you own.
    Turns:
    -   Every player will roll 2 dice, and the player with the highest total will go first.
    -   The turn order will be in a clockwise circle from the player who went first.
    -   Roll both dice and move along the board.
    -   Your action is then based on the space you land on.
    -   If both dice land on the same number, you get to roll again after taking your action. 
    Properties:
    -   There are 3 types of properties:
    o   Streets indicated by the colored bars above them. Having all the properties with the same color will give you a set.
    o   There are 4 Railroad properties indicated by the train symbol.
    o   There are 2 Utility properties indicated by the water faucet symbol and the light bulb symbol.
    -   You'll find a Title Deed card that matches each space in the bank.
    Buying Property:
    -   Landing on an unowned property allows you the option to buy the deed to that space. The cost of that space is indicated by the number at the bottom of the space.
    -   Money used to pay for the property will then be given to the bank. Any change that is owed will be given.
    -   Be sure to place the property in front of you so everyone can see what properties you own.
    Auctions:
    -   If a player chooses not to buy a property, that property is then auctioned off to all players, including the player who chose not to buy the property.
    -   Auctions start at $10, increasing by increments of $1 or more.
    -   If no players decide to bid on the property, it will go back to the bank.
    Paying Rent:
    -   If you land on a property owned by another player, you must pay the rent if the other player requests it.
    -   If the player who owns the property doesn't request money from you by the time the next player rolls the dice, they do not have to pay the rent.
    -   The amount of rent you must pay is indicated on each title deed card.
    Buying Buildings:
    -   Players must own all the properties in a set to start buying buildings in those areas.
    -   If a player owns all the property cards in a set but one or more of the cards are mortgaged, they are not allowed to buy buildings for those areas.
    -   Players can choose to buy buildings at any time. However, when I say “any time” it must be done before a player rolls the dice or after they have resolved their action.
    -   The price of the house is indicated on the Title Deed cards at the bottom.
    -   Players cannot buy a second house for a property until all properties in the set have a house.
    -   Properties can have a maximum of 4 houses. Once a property has 4 houses on it, you can then upgrade those houses to a hotel.
    o   Remove the houses and replace them with the hotel.
    o   Hotels are the highest-level buildings you can have on a property.
    o   You can no longer build any more houses on property sets with hotels.
    -   Buildings are limited, unlike money. You can run out of buildings.
    -   If 2 or more players want to buy the last house or last hotel in the bank, it is instead auctioned off.
    
    Railroads:
    -   Railroad cards have the same rules as street cards when it comes to purchasing and auctioning.
    -   Rent is instead based on how many different railroad cards you own.
    -   The amount of rent is indicated on the Title Deed cards.
    Utilities:
    -   Utility cards have the same rules as street cards when it comes to purchasing and auctioning.
    -   Rent is instead based on the roll of the dice or with a fixed multiplier.
    Tax Spaces:
    -   Tax spaces cannot be purchased by anyone.
    -   You must pay the bank the amount indicated at the bottom of the space.
    Community Chest and Chance Spaces:
    -   When a player lands on these spaces, take the card from the middle of the board. Do as the card say, then place the card back at the bottom of the deck.
    -   Do not return the "get out of jail free" card. Use the card when desired.
    -   It can be traded/sold.
    Free Parking:
    -   Nothing happens.
    Go Space:
    -   This is the starting area where the game takes place.
    -   If at any time a player passes "Go", they are given $200 from the bank.
    -   Some chance cards will tell the player to go to a certain destination. If the destination is behind the player, the player technically travels the entire board in the clockwise direction, meaning that they passed "Go".
    Jail:
    -   If you land on the Jail space, just put your figure on the side of the space where it says, "just visiting".
    -   If you land on the space with the policeman, you go to jail.
    -   If you draw a chance card that tells you to go to jail, you go to jail.
    -   If you roll doubles 3 times in a row, you go to jail.
    -   Once in jail, you cannot progress.
    -   If you want to leave jail, you have 3 options:
    o   Pay $50 to the bank.
    o   Use a "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" card.
    o   Roll doubles.
    -   Once you are free from jail, roll the dice as if it were a regular turn.
    o   If you rolled doubles to get out of jail, your movement is then based on the sum of the numbers you rolled.
    Selling:
    -   Streets without buildings, railroads, utilities, and "get out of jail free" cards can be sold to other players at any price.
    -   Selling can be done at any time in the game.
    -   Buildings on properties can be sold for half the price that they were bought for.
    -   Houses must be sold in an even order.
    -   If a hotel is sold, 4 houses take its place.
    -   Because buildings are limited, you must keep selling your buildings until you have an evenly distributed number of buildings on your properties.
    Mortgage:
    -   Property cards without buildings can be mortgaged.
    -   Flip over the card and gain money based on the amount indicated. You can always unmortgage the property later.
    -   If players land on a mortgaged space, they do not have to pay the rent.
    -   If a player lands on a different space of the set that has a mortgaged deed, they still pay the "Rent with color set" option.
    Making Deals:
    -   Aside from buildings, you can trade, sell, or make deals with anyone at any time.
    -   Giving a mortgaged property to another player gives that player 2 options:
    -   Pay the mortgage upfront, then flip over the card back to the front side.
    -   Pay the difference between the unmortgaged and mortgage cost, then keep the mortgage card.
    Bankruptcy:
    -   If you owe money to another player and you cannot pay them in full, you must then sell or mortgage anything you have to pay that player back.
    -   Players cannot give loans to other players; they must pay in full.
    -   If you owe money to another player and you go bankrupt, you must then give them the rest of your money and all the mortgage properties.
    -   If you owe the bank money and you go bankrupt, you must then give them the rest of your money, and all your properties become unmortgaged and are auctioned off to the other players.
    House Rules:
    To end this off, just know that you can create your own rules too. Have some fun and get creative. An example of a house rule that some people think is an actual rule is that all the tax money goes into a pool and when someone lands on free parking they then claim all of the money that is in the pool.

    Tactics of monopoly game
    Resource Optimization
    - Establishing a monopoly as early as possible to invest early | 3 Houses | 32 Houses max
    - Buying everything is not the best (Utilities are not as efficient). Buying coloured property give you options for negotiating or to buy houses for a colour set you have.
    - Red and Orange are the spaces for people to land upon making them the most valuable spaces on the board statistically
    - If your running low on money and you land on a space that has yet to be purchased, you can make it into an auction and perhaps buy it at a cheaper price
    
    Negotiation and Deal-Making
    - Completing a color set as early as possible by trading
    - If someone proposes a deal towards you, investigate what they have, and you may be able to make a bigger profit out of them
    - Helping another player early on, so that they can help you later (Allowing them to not play rent or give them a better trade deal)
    - You don’t need to only keep trades in game, trade with something outside the game. (Perhaps a high-five) 
    
    Late Game Strategies
    - Going/Staying to jail to avoid carelessly rolling around the board
    - Hotels do not actually provide as much of an investment and you give other players the possibility to build houses and create a comeback
    - Depending where the other players are located on the board, you can build a hotel just before someone makes their move to possibly bankrupt them (within 7 spaces)
    - If you roll and land on someone else’s property, that owner of the property has to ask you for rent, if they don't and the next player takes their turn. Then that owner cannot ask you for rent money.
    
    
    Monopoly is one of the most popular board games of all time and has essentially  become a household name. Due to the immense popularity, Hasbro has spawned copious amounts of spin-off Monopoly boards. There are over 300 different Monopoly variations!
    
    Although they may just look like simple reskins, Monopoly variations also offer slight tweaks in gameplay to tailor the experience closer to the theme of the board. The Animal Crossing board, for example, offers a simpler, more friendly experience where the game revolves around gaining Nook Miles. The game is decided by who has the highest total value of Nook Miles after a player collects a maximum of 7 pieces. You also collect “materials” based on what islands you discover(spaces you land on before anyone else). When you roll, you roll one dice that determines how many spaces you move and one that determines what material you can sell that turn for coins. Your only aim is to make enough money to buy high value furniture or to complete Nook Mile cards to acquire additional points. Furniture is purchasable after you pass go. 3 pieces of furniture are revealed at once and you may purchase up to all 3, or just 1. Each furniture piece has an accompanying point total(referred to as Nook Miles). As well for passing Go for the first time you obtain a skill card that influences the game in your favor. Whoever has the most “Nook Miles” at the end of the game is the winner! No one is forced into bankruptcy nor are there many opportunities to mess with your opponents. It’s very thematic with how Animal Crossing functions as a game (happy-go-lucky, relaxing).
    
    For the more speed-oriented and dedicated competitors exists a Monopoly board based solely on its high-octane gameplay. “The Monopoly game meant to be beaten in 10 minutes”, Monopoly Speed is chaos embodied by a board game. The rounds are decided by a timer in which everyone moves at the same time, rolling as many times as they can while the timer runs down. Title deeds are placed onto the board in their matching spots and players roll as usual. If you are the first to land on that deed, you can buy it. Doesn’t seem too different, hey? Oh just you wait… each player gets 3 community chests which act as a “goal” to guide which properties you want to prioritize obtaining. Chance cards will act as defenses and offenses during the trading phase. That leads us conveniently into the trade phase. Once the timer runs out during a buying phase, You will be given time to trade with other players. You may use chance cards to disrupt players (putting properties back, forcing them to give you properties) but conversely, they may possess a chance card that will defend them (Cancel incoming chance cards). You may reveal one chance card per phase. After this first trade phase, another buying phase will occur. Rinse and repeat for 4 rounds. The split is such:
    
    Buying Phase    Trading Phase
    Round 1: 30 seconds 40 seconds
    Round 2: 20 seconds 50 seconds
    Round 3: 20 seconds 70 seconds
    Round 4: 10 seconds 70 seconds
    
    After the 4th round, the game ends. The winner is decided by who has the most value at the end of the 4 rounds. Value is decided by the amount of cash you have, properties you own, and community chest bonuses you have satisfied. Owning a complete property sets rewards you with double rent(value).
    
    Now you may be wondering “what if I want to play Monopoly but all of my friends live away from me”, fear not! Being that we are moving into a digital age, it’s inevitable that Monopoly would capitalize on the gaming market (pun fully intended).
    
    Initially released in 2014, Monopoly Plus is a virtual game of Monopoly released by Ubisoft where you and your friends can play rounds against each other from ANYWHERE in the world as long as you have an internet connection. The classic board functions exactly how a regular game of Monopoly would, everything is controlled via a keyboard/controller. When creating games, you have preset rule sets that you can use such as snake eyes (rolling double ones gives the player $1000), but you can keep rules classic. You may also customize the rules exactly to your liking. It is essentially classic Monopoly, but playable with people around the world!
